This repository includes the scripts for performing the analyses and preprocessing included in the Final Degree Project: 

Single-cell analysis of Plexiform Neurofibromas: Heterogeneity and tumor cell-of-origin

File descriptions:


ANALYSIS:

scRNA_PNF_corrected.R ------> Contains the full analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data from 3 pNFs.

scATAC_RNA.R ------> Contains the full analysis of the Multiome single-cell ATAC + Gene Expression data from the same 3 pNFs.

scRNA_merge.R ------> Contains the full analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data from iPSC-based in vitro 3D neurofibroma models, combined with the 3 pNFs
